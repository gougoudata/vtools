# vtools

### Description
vtools makes my research job easier by making the use of Fortran and Unix less enervating.

### Todo
- add documentation
- make perspicuous and extensible API
- macro that takes a list of transforms
    - a transform has 2 parts -- a name (eg "hcp") and a transform (energy --> .25 * energy)
    - it constructs functions and applies the transforms to a given energy list
